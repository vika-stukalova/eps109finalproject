# EPS 109 Final Project

This project is a Python-based simulation that models the effects of rising sea levels on a global scale. It encompasses dynamic global maps, population displacement ratios, and water coverage projections spanning millennia.

## Introduction
The Rising Sea Levels Simulation project is a comprehensive effort to understand and visualize the long-term impact of rising sea levels on our planet. It combines geographical data, population analysis, and climate projections to provide a holistic view of the potential consequences of sea level rise.

## Features
- Global Maps: The simulation includes global maps that update to show the changing coastline and water coverage over time.

- Population Displacement Ratios: Gain insights into how rising sea levels can affect human populations. The simulation calculates and visualizes the potential displacement of people due to water encroachment.

- Millennial Projections: With projections spanning millennia, this project allows you to explore various sea level rise scenarios and their long-term impacts.

## Usage
The simulation provides an interactive interface where you can adjust parameters, such as sea level rise rates, time frames, and geographic regions. You can also export data and visualizations for further analysis.

Feel free to explore the Rising Sea Levels Simulation project and start analyzing the potential impacts of rising sea levels on our planet. We hope this tool can contribute to a better understanding of this critical environmental issue.
